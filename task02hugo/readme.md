# Portfolio Website

## Introduction

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website.
It was built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and flexible static
site generator.

## Features

- **Easy Customization**: We can easily customize the website's content,
-  layout, and styling by editing Hugo templates and CSS files.

- **Performance**: As a static website, it offers fast loading times and
-  is optimized for performance.

- **Projects Showcase**: Showcase my projects, work, or achievements in an
-  organized and visually appealing manner.

## My Experience

This is my first time working with Hugo. It was really intresting for me.
I never knew we could create amazing static websites this easily. To get
started, I had to refer to a random youtube video, but I believe that it
was defenitely worth it. I was amazed by the vast collection of templates
that we could use, on hugo's site. I decided to go with the hugo-PaperMod 
theme as it seemed very simple and minimalistic for me. At first, I had 
some issues with creating path for different folders, but I figured it out
eventually. I also learned some basic HTML and CSS along with this task.
Honestly, this was one of the task that I enjoyed the most. I am planning 
to create more amazing websites and blogs in the future.
