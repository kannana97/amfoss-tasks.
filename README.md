SELF INTRODUCTION

Hello everyone,
I'm Kannan A , currently a first-year Electronics and Communication
Engineering(ECE) student.I studied biology during my higher secondary
education, so I had no prior knowledge in computer subjects. However, I
am very passionate about learning computer. I like innovation and 
technology. I got interested in electronics at a very young age and that
really ignited a spark in me to learn and create.

WHY YOU MUST CHOOSE ME?

I believe that I'm someone who enjoys problem-solving. For me, being part
of a vibrant community encourages me, to become better everyday. I'm 
fascinated by the technology that exists in our time. I want to learn what
it takes to create that. I am really excited to enter the world of research
and development(R&D) and be part of a creation that makes people's lives better.

WHAT'S MY PLAN FOR THE NEXT 6 MONTHS ?

I want to learn and improve my programming skills. I want to study more about 
the Computers, Internet, and how they came to existence in the first place.
